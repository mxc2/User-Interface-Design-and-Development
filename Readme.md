# User Interface Design and Development / Course at Tallinn University

## Description
In the UI Design and Development course, the primary goal is to meticulously replicate a chosen website, concentrating on honing advanced CSS techniques. I chose to replicate nordicdesignhome.ee. As of 2023 August, the domain is not active anymore, so use this [picture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13VYwBTYiMFOHM_DL-PSB8nodGQaz7uPt/view?usp=sharing) as reference.

My project includes:
 - An image carousel that seamlessly links to various pages, transitioning images at regular intervals.
 - A collection of reusable components designed to curtail redundant code, all adhering to React's core principles.
 - Thoughtfully crafted navigation systems tailored for both desktop and mobile interfaces.
 - Responsive design for various screen sizes. Mobile screens included.
 - And many more successfully replicated features!
