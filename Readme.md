# User Interface Design and Development / Course at Tallinn University / University Work

## Description
In the UI Design and Development course, the primary goal is to meticulously replicate a chosen website, concentrating on honing advanced CSS techniques. I chose to replicate nordicdesignhome.ee. As of 2023 August, the domain is not active anymore, so use this [picture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13VYwBTYiMFOHM_DL-PSB8nodGQaz7uPt/view?usp=sharing) as reference.
